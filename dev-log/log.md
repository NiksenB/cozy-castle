## PR #19 - Event and outdoors (2025-05-27)

### What's changed
- Added a placeholder area for outside the castle
- Added scene transition logic
- Refactored inventory system so an inventory can exist independently of a player
- Refactored inventory system so inventory items exist independently of UI and are preserved between scenes
- Resliced a ton of tiles (I think it actually took me hours)

### Notes
Shout out to this guy, along with Github Copilot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNl--exin90&list=PL4vbr3u7UKWp0iM1WIfRjCDTI03u43Zfu&index=30

I will eventually smoothen the current scene transition with a fade-in / fade-out effect.
